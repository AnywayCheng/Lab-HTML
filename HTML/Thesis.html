          <h1>MiDSystem: A Comprehensive Online System for De Novo Assembly and Analysis of Microbial Genomes.</h1>
          <h3>(2021/11/25)</h3>
          <p>The reduction in cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques makes sequencing bacterial genomes affordable for a great number of researchers. Over the last ten years, the number of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has increased dramatically. At the same time, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) started the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) in 2007, which aimed to identify and discover functions of the microbial flora related to human health and diseases. Since then, more than 10,000 metagenomic projects have ushered bacterial studies into a new era. Owing to the explosive growth of bacterial sequencing data and projects, the needs of researchers have also shifted from sequencing to analyzing and managing the experimental results. In bacterial research, it is now basic for researchers to assemble de novo the genomes of unknown species － sequencing and assembling short reads from NGS experiments to construct a novel genome of an organism. Acquisition of substantial genetic information from environmental samples for metagenomics studies is also feasible and essential for investigators.</p>

          <h1>SparkINFERNO: a scalable high-throughput pipeline for inferring molecular mechanisms of non-coding genetic variants</h1>
          <h3>(2020/4/24)</h3>
          <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified over 70,000 genetic variants associated with more than 3000 human diseases and phenotypes. Interpretation of these associations remain difficult as most GWAS hits are in the non-coding genome. Resolution of GWAS is limited as neighboring variants have similar associations due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Our recently developed INFERNO method focuses on identifying potentially causal variants underlying observed GWAS associations by integrating with hundreds of functional genomics datasets. The current INFERNO implementation is not optimized for big data, and a scalable framework for annotating genetic variants and genomic regions generated by various human genetic studies in a high-throughput manner is in need for systematic large-scale genomic and genetic analyses.</p>

          <h1>VariED: the first integrated database of gene annotation and expression profiles for variants related to human diseases</h1>
          <h3>(2019/7/17)</h3>
          <p>Advances in microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and the widespread availability of genomic data provide a good opportunity for researchers to simultaneously analyze data from multiple molecular levels. Knowledge of detailed variant information along with corresponding gene expression profiles for specific organs is considered a key step for diagnostic and prognostic assessment of the functional effects of genetic variants. Therefore, establishing a comprehensive analytical system that provides multi-level information for a DNA variant may greatly benefit researchers.</p>

          <h1>anamiR: integrated analysis of MicroRNA and gene expression profiling</h1>
          <h3>(2019/5/14)</h3>
          <p>With advancements in high-throughput technologies, the cost of obtaining expression profiles of both mRNA and microRNA in the same individual has substantially decreased. Integrated analysis of these profiles can help to elucidate the functional effects of RNA expression in complex diseases, such as cancer. However, fundamental discrepancies are observed in the results from microRNA-mRNA target gene prediction algorithms, and few packages can be used to analyze microRNA and mRNA expression levels simultaneously.</p>

          <h1>Whole-genome de novo sequencing reveals unique genes that contributed to the adaptive evolution of the Mikado pheasant</h1>
          <h3>(2018/5/2)</h3>
          <p>The Mikado pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado) is a nearly endangered species indigenous to high-altitude regions of Taiwan. This pheasant provides an opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes following geographic isolation. Currently, the genetic background and adaptive evolution of the Mikado pheasant remain unclear.</p>

          <h1>CellExpress: a comprehensive microarray-based cancer cell line and clinical sample gene expression analysis online system</h1>
          <h3>(2018/1/12)</h3>
          <p>Cell lines play an important role as a model for conducting biological experiments and developing new therapies in cancer studies. Theoretically, cancer cell lines show similar phenotypic features to their parental cells; however, the immortalization steps of a cell line may make the genes related to proliferation and control of the cell cycle change dramatically. Therefore, huge differences in gene expression profiles across different cancer cell lines exist, even if they are classified into the same organ types. Because functional assays and biological experiments usually take time and extensive effort, challenges arise when trying to select a particular cell line from one specific organ if huge discrepancies are observed. Fortunately, with the advancement of high-throughput technologies, such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS), researchers are now able to identify cancer cell lines with unusual expression patterns. To address this issue, a systematic and comprehensive system for analyzing the gene expression levels across different cell lines is required. We developed an online analytical website with a user-friendly interface, CellExpress, which simultaneously integrates >128 tissue types and 1202 cell lines from five datasets. By using the CellExpress system, researchers can easily identify cell lines that are unsuitable for further functional studies.</p>

          <h1>Common applications of next-generation sequencing technologies in genomic research</h1>
          <h3>(2013/2/25)</h3>
          <p>High-throughput molecular analysis is a well-known technology that plays an important role in exploring biological questions in many species, especially in human genomic studies. Over the past 20 years, gene expression profiling, a revolutionary technique, has been widely used for genomic identification, genetic testing, drug discovery, and disease diagnosis, among other things. The field of genomics and proteomics research has undergone neoteric fluctuations as a result of next-generation sequencing (NGS), a paradigm-shifting technology that provides higher accuracy, larger throughput and more applications than the microarray platform. The use of massively parallel sequencing has increasingly been the object of study in recent years. The NGS technologies are implemented for several applications, including whole genome sequencing, de novo assembly sequencing, resequencing, and transcriptome sequencing at the DNA or RNA level. For instance, de novo assembly sequencing assembles the genome of a particular organism without a reference genome sequence, which may lead to a better understanding at the genomic level and may assist in predicting genes, protein coding regions, and pathways. In addition, resequencing the organism with a known genome can help in understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype and identify the differences among reference sequences. In addition, NGS technologies have been widely used to analyze small RNAs, including identification of differentially expressed micro RNAs (miRNAs), prediction of novel miRNAs, and annotation of other small non-coding RNAs.</p>

          <h1>miRSystem: An Integrated System for Characterizing Enriched Functions and Pathways of MicroRNA Targets</h1>
          <h3>(2012/8/1)</h3>
          <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs which regulate their corresponding target genes through post-transcriptional repression. It has been shown that miRNAs play important roles in many cellular processes such as stress responses, hematopoiesis, radiation responses, and the immune system. A growing body of evidence has indicated that dysregulation of miRNAs results in several diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and multiple cancers. Therefore, treatment of those diseases may be improved with better understanding of how miRNAs participate in regulation of gene expression during pathogenic processes.</p>
